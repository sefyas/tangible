//  - sort tags ascendingly based on id
//  - find the range for selection, action, and number tags
//  - for each pair of numbers and actions/secodndary selections tags
//      - find the vector connecting the centers of the two tags and normalize it
//      - consider the two as grouped if
//          - the center to center distance is ~TAG_EDGE
//          - the dot product of the normalized center to center and the x-axis is ~1
//      ! the grouping is 1-1 => visited (i.e. already grouped) can be removed from the pool
//  - for each pair of actions and selections tags
//      similar to number-action/secondary selection but should find the minimum 
//      center-2-center distance and should check alignment with y-axis
//  ! repeated numbers ---> selection and secondary selection that should be grouped but this
//    can wait to be done during instruction generation
